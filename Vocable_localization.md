# Vocable localization

## Crowdin
on release (current, and retain)
vs 
Over the air (desired)

## How it works right now
There are several .ymls that seem to not work, I think Chris just manually downloaded and added the localization files


## Test App
- I've created a crowdin test account with a CDN by crowdin
- I've integrated the SDK into a test app and real app
- I want to finish researching and then manually add the localization files
    -   then download and update with a fallback

- create a project thing on github
